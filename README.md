# Code Challenge - Forms

In this challenge I would like for you to build a form that is to be used by a fictional employee to log their work time on a ticket. The fields required are as follow with their character limit and correct validation:

    - Ticket Name (7 characters) example APP-120
    - Description (100 characters) 
    - Date (10 characters) MM/DD/YYYY
    - Start Time (7 characters)
    - End Time (7 characters)
    - Hours Worked (Calculated from the start time and end time) READONLY

The form should contain validation for each writeable field and it should output a JSON object with the final values( you can choose where to output the values, another UI component, console.log, alert, JSON.stringify()...). Use any library that you might feel the need for it.

***Bonus points***
- Well written comments
- Proper time parsing in order to store the values in a database
- Styling the form ( Show us some css magic :smiley:) 
- React hooks :rocket:

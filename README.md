# Code Challenge - Forms

In this challenge I would like for you to build a form that is to be used by a fictional employee to log their work time on a jira ticket. The fields required are as follow with their character limit and correct validation:

- Ticket Name (max 10 characters, alphanumeric characters and -) example APP-120
- Description (max 100 characters, alphanumeric characters and -) description of the work.
- Date (10 characters) MM/DD/YYYY
- Start Time (7 characters) 10:00am
- End Time (7 characters) 1:15pm

The form should contain validation for each writeable field and it should output a JSON object with the final values( you can choose where to output the values, another UI component, console.log, alert, JSON.stringify(output)...).

***Bonus points***

- Well written comments
- Styling the form ( Show us some css magic :smiley:) 
- React hooks :rocket:
- Calculate Total time between End Time and Start Time worked on the ticket and display it in this format `1 hour and 15 minutes`

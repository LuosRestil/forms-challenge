# Code Challenge - Forms

In this challenge I would like for you to build a form that is to be used by a fictional employee to log their work time on a ticket. The fields required are as follow with their character limit and correct validation:

    - Ticket Name (7 characters) example APP-120
    - Description (100 characters) 
    - Date (10 characters) MM/DD/YYYY
    - Start Time (7 characters)
    - End Time (7 characters)
    - Hours Worked (Calculated from the start time and end time) READONLY

The form should contain validation for each writeable field and it should output a JSON object with the final values to the UI.

***Bonus points***

- Proper time parsing in order to store the values in a database
- Styling the form ( Show us some css magic :smiley:) 
- React hooks
